ML_test_exercise_week_2
=======================

Test cases for Machine Learning Programming Exercises - IV. Linear Regression with Multiple Variables (Week 2) at https://class.coursera.org/ml/assignment/index

Installation
------------

Clone or download the project into the folder where you keep the files for the Machine Learning Programming Exercises for Week 2.

Your exercise files are typically in a folder named `ex1/`.

* If you clone the project, you'll have a folder `ex1/ML_test_exercise_week_2/`,
* If you download a zip file and unpack it in `ex1`, it'll be something like `ex1/ende76-ML_test_exercise_week_2-cd2dfad/`.

That's it, installation done.

How to use
----------

Change into your `ex1/` dir and start octave.

In octave's shell, use the command

* `runtests('./ML_test_exercise_week_2/')`, or – if you used the zip file –
* `runtests('./ende76-ML_test_exercise_week_2-cd2dfad/')`, or similar.

This will run all tests defined in the files in that folder.
Whenever a test fails due to a known mistake, it should give you a `RECOMMENDATION` telling you how to fix your problem.
At this time, there is a lot of output from octave that is hard to avoid which might be confusing.
Just look for the line with `RECOMMENDATION`, which should be all you need to care about.
